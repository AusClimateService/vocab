# Australian Climate Service vocabulary

This repository contains the controlled vocabulary used by the [Australian Climate Service](https://www.acs.gov.au) and partners. The purpose of the vocabulary is to ensure a consistent use of concepts across partners and customers.

Initial definitions of concepts were developed from existing definitions provided by UNDRR, AIDR, WMO and ACS partners.

## Format

The vocabulary is maintained in a spreadsheet conforming to [SKOS vocabulary standards](https://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/). It allows easier implementation for a concept scheme, concepts and their features, and concept collections. See the "README" tab on the spreadsheet for more information. Presently we are not enforcing concept URIs in the definitions. This will be addressed in the future.

## Publication

The vocabulary is published on Geoscience Australia's [Vocabulary Service](https://vocabs.ga.gov.au).

## Adding and modifying definitions

To add a new definition or modify an existing definition, create an [issue](https://github.com/AusClimateService/vocab/issues) and use the relevant issue template to submit the addition/modification. The proposed definition will be reviewed by custodians (in consultation with ACS partners) before implementing the requested addition/modification.

## Custodians

The vocabulary is maintained by a Core Terminology Group, with members from across the ACS partners. The Core Terminology Group are responsible for reviewing any new/modified definitions before inclusion in the published vocabulary.
